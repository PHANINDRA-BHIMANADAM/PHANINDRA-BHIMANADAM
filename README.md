## 💡 What I Bring to the Table

- **Problem-Solving**: From optimizing algorithms to designing innovative machine learning models, I thrive on tackling complex challenges.
- **HR Technologies**: Workday Adaptive Planning, Anaplan Workforce Planning. Using **workforce strategy and predictive analytics**, I leverage these tools to optimize planning and drive data-driven decisions that improve organizational outcomes.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Leveraging my skills in **Data Science** and **AI**,Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, I transform raw data into actionable insights that drive business outcomes.
- **Project Management**: SAFe Agile, Scrum, User Stories, Personas, Epics, Features, and Sprints. I use **Agile methods** to streamline workflows, improve teamwork, and deliver results in manageable steps. 
- **Cloud Mastery**: Cloud technologies (AWS, Azure) are my playground. Whether it's building serverless apps or designing scalable infrastructure, I'm all in.
- **Leadership & Collaboration**: As a former Student Union President, I led a team of 8 students under the guidance of 2 lecturers to implement the **Learn from Home** initiative during the COVID-19 lockdown, ensuring 700+ students received quality education. Using **Workday Adaptive Planning and Agile methodologies**, I managed and optimized timetables for over 25 lecturers. Through **Agile sprints**, We continuously monitored attendance, adjusted schedules, and ensured smooth execution of virtual sessions. This experience sharpened my leadership, resource management, and project coordination skills, making me adept at managing large-scale projects under tight deadlines.
